Passwords Tidy Tuesday data analysis

First time making tables, so I attempted some light data analysis and cleaning to look at bad passwords, their relative strength, as well as how long they take to hack when computing offline. Because this data comes from one source (https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/top-500-passwords-visualized/), I wanted to provide some popular passwords so that the viewer understands common passwords in each category and what they may look like.

The R code for the data, data cleaning, and the table can all be found under "password_analysis_script."
